<h2>How should we think about AI ethics?</h2>
<p>Data-driven and AI-based technologies have abilities to solve many great challenges, but they also raise potential risks to individuals, groups, and/ or society. As we deploy new technologies, we must consider ethical ramifications of AI use to identify and rectify harms. The responsible design and use of AI and data are not easy to address, but there is an urgent need for it in our current ecosystem. When organizations adopt new technologies without regard to the wider social, economic, cultural, and political contexts, they can endanger privacy and security and exacerbate inequities in ways that are difficult to reverse. Ethical principles governing emerging technologies are lacking in most organizations, according to Shein (2022).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ethical AI risks are not only bad because doing the wrong thing is bad. The ethical risks that organisations can realise in their AI development and deployment also reputational, regulatory, and legal risks that could cost a firm hundreds of millions in fines, and legal fees, and tremendous amount of time and something it is notoriously difficult to regain once lost (i.e., client and customer trust).</p>
<p>Many companies want to be on the cutting edge of emerging technologies to stay competitive and gain benefits such as improved customer experience, operational efficiencies and newly enabled use cases.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/about-deloitte/articles/technology-trust-ethics-annual-report.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Deloitte’s report's</a>&nbsp;<a></a><a></a><a></a>(2022, para 1),</p>
<blockquote>
<p>these technologies are often being developed at such breakneck speeds that few companies are pausing to consider the ethical implications,...With great power comes great responsibility. And with unprecedented opportunities, the promise of emerging technologies comes with the potential for their misuse.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Technology doesn’t have inherent values; it’s up to the people who create and use it to consciously embed ethical principles in it. Which is why trustworthy and ethical technology must become the responsibility of those who make and deploy it—and the only way to succeed is to place ethics at the centre of technology development.</p>
<p>It is commonly understood that ‘an ethical point of view’ means respecting not only your own goals/aspirations but considering the goals/aspirations of other people as well. Ethics is the philosophical study or morality. Morality refers to guidelines for determining what you ought to do in a particular situation. Morality also allows you to figure out whether a particular decision or action is right or wrong. Morality is focused on solving particular problems while Ethics is broader and includes the higher-level activities of evaluating moral systems and the creation of new ways of evaluating moral problems.</p>
<p>According to Blackman (2022), although we all agree that ethics is a very important aspect of a good society, when talking about ethics, people often argue that their ethics is different from others’ ethics, or ethics is subjective because ethics or morality varies across cultures and individual’s values and philosophy. As a result, they are not quite sure how to think about it and they usually given up trying. However, it will be different in an organisation context. If you are an organisation senior manager who is trying to create a comprehensive AI ethical risk program for your firm, it is not right for you to say: “Well, ethics is subjective, but…” because your responsibility is to get the ethics principles right and get people buy-in. Your job is to make people to think about ethics in a way that isn’t met with a shrug whenever they need to do some ethical thinking, as required by AI ethics program, in undertaking ethical risk assessment during AI system development or deployment. If you are an AI developer, AI user, or a member of an ethics committee, you need to consider some risks behind AI if something goes wrong and who will be responsible for the decision made by AI.</p>

<p>Blackman (2022) explains that it is very common when people think of ethics as subjective as because they fail to differentiate between people’s beliefs about ethics – what they believe to be ethically right or wrong, good, or bad, etc.- and ethics itself. As running these two things together, they make misguided claims about subjectivity of ethics when they are really making claims about&nbsp;<u>variance of people’s beliefs</u>. Therefore, when people argue that their ethics is different from others’ ethics and that “your ethics is different from my ethics” can mean either “what’s ethically right for you is ethically wrong for me” or “what you believe is ethically right something I believe is ethically wrong”. Ethical beliefs change or evolve over time but that doesn’t mean that what is right and wrong changes over time.</p>
<p>It is dangerous to view ethics as completely subjective because if it is subjective, then there is no responsible ethical inquiry because no one can possibly be incorrect in their conclusions and so much for responsible AI. Therefore, on the one hand, it is important to defuse the view because it will continually put a stop to fruitful discussions and be an obstacle to genuine organisational buy-in. On the other hand, it is essential to view ethics as being something objective, as something we can reasonably change our mind about, so we will be able to attempt to address ethical inquiry being a tool (i.e., an AI ethical risk program) at our disposal to solve ethical and technical problems of AI. Establishing ethical technology structures, policies, practices, and frameworks for ethical tech assessment gives companies the freedom to act quickly and decisively, while maintaining an alignment with organizational purpose.</p>
<p>Recently there is a call by more than 1,000 artificial intelligence experts, researchers and backers for an immediate pause on the creation of “giant” AIs for "at least six months, so the capabilities and dangers of <a data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/mar/14/chat-gpt-4-new-model">systems such as GPT-4</a> can be properly studied and mitigated" (Hern 2023, p. 1).&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/mar/29/elon-musk-joins-call-for-pause-in-creation-of-giant-ai-digital-minds" target="_blank" rel="noopener">See the article here</a></p>
