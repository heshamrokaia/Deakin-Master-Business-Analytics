<h2>Guidelines to develop ethical AI program</h2>
<p>As discussed in section 7.2, conducting a comprehensive AI ethics risk assessment, and regularly monitoring the impacts of AI are critical components of AI Governance Strategy. In this section, we will examine how to develop an effective ethical AI program to monitor and manage AI risks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Developing a data and AI ethics program is not a one-size-fits-all solution. Since companies across different industries have different values and requirements, it is important to customise a data and AI ethics program to address the specific business and regulatory needs of a company. There are guidelines that can be used to build an ethical AI program. According to Blackman (2020) there are seven key steps to develop a personalized, functional, expandable, and long-lasting data AI ethics program that minimises risk. These are:&nbsp;</p>

<h4><img src="1.jpg" alt="1" title="1" width="25" height="24"> Organisations should leverage existing infrastructure, such as a data governance board.</h4>
<p>The support and engagement of senior leaders within the organisation demonstrates their commitment to the program and their involvement also shows to employees the seriousness of the program. Board members should be involved in making important decisions which include the AI strategy and should provide support and resources to minimise reputational, regulatory and legal risk, protect the organisation’s interest and ultimately make the program successful.&nbsp;</p>
<h4><img src="2.jpg" alt="2" title="2" width="25" height="24"> Develop a data and AI ethical risk framework that is specific to your industry.&nbsp;</h4>
<p>The framework should include clear statements of the organisation’s ethical standards and potential ethical issues that could arise. It should also identify relevant internal and external stakeholders, recommend a governance structure, and determine how that structure will adapt to changes in personnel and other situations. Key performance indicators (KPI) and an assurance program need to be established. By defining and monitoring KPIs, organisations can ensure that their program is maintaining their effectiveness and achieving the intended outcome. &nbsp;Organisations need to ensure a quality assurance program to comply with relevant ethical standards, regulations and laws. As you saw in Topic 6, organisations need to have processes in place that mitigate biased algorithms, to ensure privacy and to be able to explain unusual outputs.</p>
<h4><img src="3.jpg" alt="3" title="3" width="25" height="24">&nbsp;Learn from industries that have had success.</h4>
<p>Executives can learn and adopt the approaches taken by the health care industry towards risk mitigation. For several decades the health care industry has established and refined specific processes, and practices that are designed to identify, assess, and mitigate ethical risks in a consistent and systematic manner. The issues of privacy, self-determination, and informed consent have been extensively examined by various experts in the medical and healthcare industry, as well as legal and regulatory professionals. This has been critical to ensuring that patients' rights and interests are protected. Patients are treated once they have given their informed consent. For instance, just as patients have the right to determine how their medical data is used, consumers should have control over how their personal data is collected, processed, and shared by organisations. By applying similar principles used in the health care industry to the handling of personal data, the rights and interests of individuals can be protected, and the individual would have control over how their data is collected, processed, and shared.</p>
<h4><img src="4.jpg" alt="4" title="4" width="25" height="24"> Provide product managers with guidance and tools that are specifically tailored to their needs.</h4>
<p>While high-level guidance is helpful, it is often not enough to address the specific challenges that product managers face when creating and managing products. For example, in Machine Learning models how would managers incorporate ‘explainability’ into the process to lead to better outcomes? Product managers need to make a balanced decision considering the importance of making outputs ‘explainable’ (which can lead to inaccuracies) and ‘accurate’ (leading to being less explainable). For example, if biased outputs are not a concern, then explainability may not be as important relative to accuracy. If, however, an organisation falls under certain regulations where the output requires an explanation, then this would be favoured over accuracy. This situation is seen in the banking industry, where the criteria for declining an individual for a bank loan needs to be transparent.&nbsp;</p>
<h4><img src="5.jpg" title="" width="25" height="24"> Develop an organizational culture that promotes awareness of data and AI ethics strategy.</h4>
<p>To successfully implement and maintain a data and AI ethics strategy, it is important to create a culture that values and prioritizes ethical decision-making. These days data and AI ethics are important in all areas of an organisation, not just restricted to certain departments. Anyone that interacts with data or AI products needs to understand the ethical considerations involved. This may mean further education and upskilling employees on the organisation’s ethical framework, enabling them to ask important questions and concerns at critical junctures.&nbsp;</p>
<h4><img src="6.jpg" alt="6" title="6" width="25" height="24"> Get buy-in from employees.</h4>
<p>It is essential to encourage employees, both formally and informally, to participate in identifying ethical risks related to AI. Financial incentives to encourage unethical behaviour of employees can compromise the organisation's ethical standards. This has been observed on a number of occasions, with the Wells Fargo cross-selling scandal being an example. At the same time, an organisation failing to financially reward ethical conduct can result in the employee feeling overlooked. Furthermore, if employees don’t see that the organisation is investing in a robust data and AI ethics program, they may not see it as important and shift their focus on what will benefit their career advancement.&nbsp;</p>
<h4><img src="7.jpg" alt="7" title="7" width="25" height="24"> Engage stakeholders and monitor impacts following AI deployment.</h4>
<p>Even if all the steps in the guidelines from the ethics framework were followed by employees, things can go wrong. Limited time and resources and the inability to predict how things can go wrong are all factors that can lead to subpar outcome. &nbsp;It is therefore necessary to monitor AI products and/or services once it is in the public domain to ensure that it is being used ethically. An analogy to illustrate this point, is saying that just like a car can be built with all the safety features, it is still not safe to drive at high speeds on a side street. Likewise, an AI product can be developed ethically but used in an unethical way. Both quantitative and qualitative research is needed to understand the impact of data and AI products. It is essential to consult stakeholders (e.g., customers, employees and the wider community) to determine how they are affected by the ‘product’ and to receive their feedback on what the product should and should not do. Engaging stakeholders early in the process ensures that the product is designed and developed in alignment with their values and needs. &nbsp;</p>
