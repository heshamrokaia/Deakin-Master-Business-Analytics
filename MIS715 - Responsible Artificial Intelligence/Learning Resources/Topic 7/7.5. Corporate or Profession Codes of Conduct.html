<h2>Corporate or Profession Codes of Conduct</h2>
<p>You have learnt so far different approaches for organisations to implement both AI governance strategies and frameworks to implement these. There is also the responsibility on the part of the individual employee to behave ethically when using AI. Their behaviour is guided by their profession's as well as organisation’s code of conduct.</p>
<p>Although there are existing law that can be applied to protect humans and our society (e.g., anti-discrimination laws, or when it comes to AI driverless cars (self-driving cars), laws against killing and maiming pedestrians can be applied), organisations need to build a comprehensive code of conduct for their employees to follow that might help them to prevent and manage AI risks and unethical behaviours as employees.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>container callout</h3>
<p>In this section, we will focus on codes of conduct that are set by organisations and professional bodies that provide their members with a set of standards they are required to adhere to. &nbsp;</p>
<hr>
<h3><strong>container instructions</strong></h3>
<p>Click on the plus signs to learn more about the two different codes of conduct</p>
<hr>
<h3><strong>accordion</strong></h3>
<h4>Organisation’s code of conduct</h4>
<p>Human Resource policy outlines the standards of behaviour expected by organisation from every employee including ethical principles, values, accountability, standards of conduct, standards of practice, and mechanisms for disciplinary action. The policy is particularly designed and customised for each specific organisation. Therefore, different organisations have different codes of conduct that their employees have to follow. &nbsp;Bramwell Partners (2023) has provided several guidance on how organisations can design their code of conduct.<a href="https://bramwellpartners.com.au/importance-of-code-of-conduct/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> See here for the details.</a>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Professional code of conduct</h4>
<p>The set of principles which describe the professional conduct, personal conduct and professional competence expected from each member of a profession. Ethics is at the core of any professional and it is absolutely necessary, and all professional bodies put so much emphasis on the need for members to abide by ethical codes of conduct.&nbsp;</p>
<hr>
<p>Australian Council of Professions (‘Professions Australia’) states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A profession is a disciplined group of individuals who adhere to ethical standards and who hold themselves out as and are accepted by the public as possessing special knowledge and skills in a widely recognised body of learning derived from research, education and training at a high level, and who are prepared to apply this knowledge and exercise these skills in the interest of others…”</p>
<p><em>Australian Council of Professions, 2023, Para. 1</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Examples of professional codes of conduct are the codes of professional conduct for registered nurses, for registered tax agent, BAS agent or tax (financial) adviser in Australia. Of closest relevance to AI business professionals is the code of conduct of the Australian Computer Society (ACS) which many of you might be aware of.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Code of Professional Conduct of the Australian Computer Society (ACS) says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An essential characteristic of a profession is the need for its members to abide by a code of ethics. For the ACS, this code is established as the Code of Professional Conduct and is part of the Society's Regulations. These Regulations apply to any ACS member who works in the field of information and communications technology (ICT)”</p>
<p><em>ACS, 2014</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The ACS essentially views all ICT collectively as a profession including digital transformation/IS/Business Analysts/Analytics professions. It is like Engineers Australia viewing engineering as a profession (e.g., electrical, mechanical, etc combined).</p>
<p>The ACS emphasised that the use of information and communications technologies (ICT) has transformed society and the competent application of ICT technical skills is necessary for the well-being of contemporary society; therefore, the technical knowledge and skills of ICT professionals are important. But the way they are applied is what distinguishes a professional. Professionals are expected to promote good while working within <strong>ethical constraints</strong>.</p>
<p>Corporate or profession code of conduct govern people’s behaviours so that they can be aware of what behaviours are good and what are bad. They are quite standard, so people know for the most part, how not to do bad things. However, in the case of AI, ethical risk is not realised as a result of bad behaviours. It is the outcome of not thinking through the consequences, not monitoring the AI, not knowing what one should be on the lookout for when developing or deploying AI.&nbsp;</p>
<h3><i class="fa fa-book" style="font-size: 24px;"></i><strong style="font-size: 1em;">&nbsp;Optional Reading</strong></h3>
<p>For further details, read the full <a href="https://www.acs.org.au/content/dam/acs/rules-and-regulations/Code-of-Professional-Conduct_v2.1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ACS code of conduct (2014) </a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The values specified in the ACS code are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Primacy of the Public Interest</li>
<li>Enhancement of Quality of Life</li>
<li>Honesty</li>
<li>Competence</li>
<li>Professional Development</li>
<li>Professionalism</li>
</ul>
<p>Apart from the code of conduct framework, ethicists also provide some guidance based on their theories and perspectives. Ethicists’ goals are to provide guidance on establishing a fair and just society, enabling everyone to prosper - “the Good Life” (!). The guide is typically informed by ethical theories. They also aim to provide a guide to decision-making when confronted by dilemmas – those awful situations where “good” for one or some is at the same time “bad” for another or others and the guide is typically taking the form of guidelines and principles derived from theory.</p>
<p><strong>In OUR context </strong>– Reflecting especially on issues brought into play by the development of technology, and issues faced directly by professionals who design and deploy digital transformation solutions, there are several general approaches we should take into consideration:</p>
<ul>
<li>We can base our ethical compass on religions, customs, families and friends – <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRdfX7ut8gw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tradition</a></li>
<li>We can apply rules and precepts, developed according to reason&nbsp;</li>
<li>We can reject the “rule-based” approach but try to develop our moral character such that we are better equipped to resolve ethical dilemmas -Virtue Ethics – both ancient and modern!</li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, corporate codes of conduct and professional codes of conducts are needed to urge good judgement, integrity, and high ethical standards. Corporate codes of conduct govern people’s behaviours so that they can be aware of what behaviours are acceptable and unacceptable in a professional setting. People know for the most part how not to do bad things. If they don’t, training will be offered.</p>
