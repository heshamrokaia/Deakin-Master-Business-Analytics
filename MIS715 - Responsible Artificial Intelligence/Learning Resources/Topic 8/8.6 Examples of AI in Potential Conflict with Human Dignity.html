<h2>&nbsp;Examples of AI in Potential Conflict with Human Dignity</h2>
<p>Consider the following case studies that illustrates the harm to humans that can be caused by AI systems if not developed and deployed responsibly.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Example 1: </strong></p>
<p>According to a report by BBC, Ibrahim Diallo suggests that while automation can be beneficial to a company, there must be a contingency plan in place for humans to take over in the event of a machine error. In 2017, Diallo was fired by an automated system without any clear reason, leaving him jobless for three weeks. The issue began with his access card becoming inoperable and eventually escalated to him being escorted out of the building by security staff “like a thief" due to system-generated messages (Wakefield 2018). Diallo (2018, June 17) said the message that made him jobless was “soulless and written in red as it gave orders that dictated my fate” and the system was "out for blood", resulting in him being the first victim of the system. After three weeks, his line manager discovered the problem (an employee who had left the company had not approved an action), and Diallo's employment was reinstated.&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Case 1 analysis:</h4>
<p>Diallo’s dismissal and subsequent escort from the building was unjust, as he hadn’t done anything wrong. This treatment, described by Diallo as being like a criminal, constitutes a loss of dignity. It is unacceptable for a human to be treated as a criminal and made redundant for the sole reason that a non-transparent system failed to respond to the intervention attempt from his line manager. AI systems intended to aid in human resources decisions must not only be transparent and understandable but also work in tandem with humans rather than being pitted against them. In the given scenario, Diallo’s perceived wrongdoing by others contributed to the potential violation of his dignity during his forced removal from the workplace.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The concept of dignity is relevant in this case because of the way others judged Diallo and the impact it had on his self-respect. Therefore, the term ‘dignity’ is applicable in discussing the moral dilemmas presented in the case. This suggests that ‘dignity’ is not merely a conversation stopper, but a useful concept in the context of AI ethics. However, it is argued that the concept of dignity is not necessary to draw ethical conclusions of this case as unfair dismissal caused by a non-transparent AI system. This viewpoint suggests that there is no moral dilemma as there are no conflicting claims to reconcile. The solution is to prevent unfair dismissals due to non-transparent AI system by using appropriate technical or organisational measures. Furthermore, it is imperative to ensure adequate solutions are accessible to employees and workers who encounter circumstances similar to Diallo’s. (Wakefield, 2018).</p>

<p><strong>Example 2: </strong></p>
<p>A senior citizen residing in her aged-care accommodation spends her time petting her pet robot seal companion without any human interaction for days. In the absence of visitors, a humanoid robot arrives, delivers her food, and attempts to imitate conversation about the weather while encouraging her to finish her meal. Despite her reluctance, the elderly woman complies with the robot’s advice and finishes her food. Afterwards, she expresses her appreciation to her pet robot seal: ‘At least you give my life some meaning’ she says. (Sharkey 2014).&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Case 2 analysis:&nbsp;</h4>
<p>Sharkey (2014) identifies the use of companion robots, such as the robot seal, described in the case, presents an ethical challenge regarding human dignity. This is because offering these robots as the sole replacement for human reaction could lead to the infantilisation of elderly people in the in the eyes of caregivers, and potentially undermine their self-respect. Additionally, the use of these robots may give rise to concerns about the provision of “cold and mechanical” care, which may be perceived as abandoning elderly people and handing them with robots that lack human contact. One of the main concerns put forward by Sharkey (2014) is the potential infantilisation of elderly people in care who engage with robot pets, as perceived by carers. The case is complex when using a dignity lens.</p>
<p>Zardiashvili and Fosch-Villaronga (2020) identify eight major ethical concerns in relation to the use of care robots for the elderly. These include safe human–robot interaction, the allocation of responsibility, privacy and data protection loss, autonomy restriction, deception and infantilisation, objectification and loss of control, human– human interaction decrease, and long-term consequences. While the authors acknowledge that robots can address issues such as loneliness, help restore mobility to wheelchair users and aid the visually impaired, they also recognise that robots can challenge the dignity of users and that human contact is an essential aspect of personal care. When dealing with care robots, it is important to treat potential dignity issues as one of several ethical challenges. This approach will allow for a proportional response to the ethical risks associated with the technology, particularly in light of the significant shortage of care staff. See the figure below for an overview of these ethical challenges.</p>

<hr>
<p>Dignity has been a concept that has achieved consensus among negotiators from diverse backgrounds since the early days of drafting human rights documents due to its flexible interpretation across religious, philosophical and pragmatic perspectives (Schroeder 2012; Tiedemann 2006). However, this could be problematic in AI ethics debates if dignity considerations are given precedence over all other ethical values.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While prioritising dignity in extreme violations like torture, human trafficking, slavery and reproductive manipulation may seem logical, it should be viewed equal among other ethical values in AI ethics debates to avoid its complete loss. This approach is endorsed by those who view dignity as a catchphrase.</p>
<p>When designing and using care robots, the dignity of the elderly is a crucial consideration that should be evaluated alongside other ethical dilemmas. All relevant ethical values should be considered when assessing the potential advantages and drawbacks of care robots.&nbsp;</p>
