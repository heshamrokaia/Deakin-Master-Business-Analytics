<h2>Hello and Welcome to Responsible Artificial Intelligence</h2>
<p>Welcome to Responsible AI. You will have some idea of what Artificial Intelligence (AI) is but possibly not so much when it comes to responsible AI.&nbsp;<br>The rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and automation are affecting almost every aspect of modern society. The new technologies not only have significant impacts on how people, businesses, and societies operate but also raise societal and ethical problems for organisations and societies. This unit aims to equip students with the knowledge and skills to understand and evaluate the social and ethical issues raised by AI technologies in various contexts. Students will critically examine, analyse, and apply ethical and governance perspectives to the design, development, and deployment of AI technologies responsibly.</p>
<p>The focus of the unit will be in the challenges and solutions to the design and implementation, and adoption of Responsible AI, reflecting the ethical and moral obligations embedded in both the systems and in our use of AI systems. Responsible AI presents significant challenges as an area as it is developing rapidly, has significant breadth and diversity, and spans legal, social, ethical, global, and technological considerations. The unit aims to impart a fundamental understanding of the pertinent issues and their application to current and future AIs. There will be technology and terminology that are new, and the path to success lies in digging deep enough to expose the requisite knowledge but not so deep that its relevance is obscured.</p>
<h3>Unit team</h3>
<p>My name is <strong>Dr. Van-Hau Trieu, </strong>an Associate Professor at Deakin Business School. This trimester, I will be the unit chair.</p>
<p>The MIS715 teaching team includes <strong>Dr. Jayson Lamchek</strong> and <strong>Dr. Jean Chong</strong>. From the first week, Dr. Lamchek will teach lectures and both on-campus and online seminars. Dr. Chong will teach the seminars at the Burwood campus.</p>
<h3>Communicating with the unit team</h3>
<p>I will regularly post important announcements on the&nbsp;home page.</p>
<p>If you have any questions about the unit then please post a message on the discussion board, as there may be other students that can also benefit from the response. But if you have a personal issue that you want to discuss, then please send an email to me at<b> </b><a href="mailto:t.trieu@deakin.edu.au"><b>t.trieu@deakin.edu.au</b></a><b> </b></p>
<p><b>Note:</b> I often send emails to Deakin email addresses with student-specific updates relating to assessment submissions etc. It is, therefore, critical that you check your Deakin email address regularly. This email can be automatically forwarded to another email address if preferred. See instructions at <a href="https://support.deakin.edu.au/kb_view_customer.do?sysparm_article=KB0010492" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Microsoft Outlook – Forwarding Deakin Emails to Other Email Addresses</a>. Please note that I do not check emails on weekends or public holidays.</p>
<p><b>Also note:</b> Any communication with Deakin staff <u>must be via a Deakin email address</u> only, <b>NOT</b> work or other addresses (e.g., gmail, hotmail, etc.) This is to protect the security and privacy of personal information for all students.</p>

<h3>How should you approach the unit?</h3>
<p>Each week you are expected to completely familiarise yourself with the topic content. This means that you will read through the content in detail and, along the way, try the embedded quiz questions and other activities to check your understanding of concepts. This is in preparation for your lecture and seminar, where you are expected to be an active participant.</p>
<p>The first week is an introduction to the unit, and you will familiarise yourself with the unit structure and context. From week 2, each Topic will focus on the ethical aspects of AI and how.</p>
<p>The weekly <strong>lecture</strong> will be recorded and available on the unit site on Wednesdays (after 8:00 pm). <strong>Seminar</strong> <em>recordings</em> will be available on the unit site on Fridays (after 8:00 am). This approach is designed to build your skills in preparation for the assignments incrementally.</p>
<h3>Unit learning resources</h3>
<p>Learning resources include online independent and collaborative learning activities engaging with the unit content (e.g., reading weekly materials, watching concept videos, doing interactive activities, participating in online discussions, etc.) and completing assessment tasks.</p>
<p>The learning environment for this unit is online through this CloudDeakin site. All teaching materials, including lecture and seminar content, will be made available in the 'Content' folder on CloudDeakin. The topics have been designed to develop sequentially from Topic 1 through to Topic 10. The complexity of the material is designed to increase each week, and each week builds on the previous week's learning. It is recommended that you follow the designed sequence of the presented material to avoid creating potential gaps in your knowledge and skills related to this Unit.</p>
<h4>Textbook</h4>
<p>The recommended textbook for this unit is:</p>
<p>Blackman, R, Ethical Machines: Your Concise Guide to Totally Unbiased, Transparent, and Respectful AI, Harvard Business Review Press, 2022.

<h3>Academic Integrity</h3>
<p>As a Deakin student, you're part of a community – a group of students and staff with a commitment to teaching, learning, and research. An important aspect of being part of this Deakin community is for you to understand and demonstrate the values of honesty, trust, fairness, respect, and responsibility, both in your studies and your interactions with other people.</p>
<p>Plagiarism is copying of another person's ideas or expressions (including lecturers and other students) without appropriate acknowledgment and presenting these ideas or forms of expression as your own. Intention to cheat is irrelevant in determining whether plagiarism has occurred – if you pass off the work of others as your own without acknowledgement, then you have offended, whether you knew you were doing it or not.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.deakin.edu.au/students/help/about-clouddeakin/help-guides/assessment/plagiarism" target="_blank" rel="noopener">turnitin</a> – an online product which will be used to detect plagiarism in assessment. For further information - see Unit Guide and Assessment Tasks</p>
<p>Collusion - <i>"Vittoria discusses an assignment with her friend Caroline, who studied the same unit last year. Vittoria asks Caroline whether she can have a look at her old assignment, and Caroline lends it to her. Caroline explains the criteria she used to analyse the sources. Vittoria submits her paper using the same criteria and assignment structure as Caroline's. Both Vittoria and Caroline could face an allegation of collusion."</i> (emphasis added) - quoted from <a href="https://www.deakin.edu.au/students/studying/academic-integrity/responsibilities" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Academic integrity responsibilities</a>.</p>
<h3>Applying for extensions and special consideration</h3>
<p>In industry, you will not get extensions on your work, except in extreme circumstances.</p>
<p>The goal of our school is to prepare students for industry. This means that graduates must have skills and professionalism to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Keep backups of all work (e.g., in cloud storage, multiple copies).</li>
<li>Manage time and <b>finish projects early</b> (i.e., allowing for possible illness during the project). <b>Plan time to allow for possible illness</b>.</li>
<li>Encourage weekly assessment drafts and progress (e.g., having drafts ready to show during seminars).</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Extensions will only be granted for exceptional and/or unavoidable circumstances outside the student's control.</b></p>
<p>Students seeking an extension for an assignment prior to the due date should apply directly on the Unit Site (<i>Assessment &gt; Extension Request</i>). When requesting an extension, you need to provide evidence to support your request (e.g., attach a medical certificate). You must also attach <b>a draft of the work that you have completed on the assessment to date.</b> You must be able to demonstrate exceptional circumstances.</p>
<p><b>Special Consideration:</b> Applications for <a href="https://www.deakin.edu.au/students/studying/assessment-and-results/special-consideration" target="_blank" rel="noopener">special consideration</a>&nbsp;after this time <b>must </b>be submitted via StudentConnect.</p>
