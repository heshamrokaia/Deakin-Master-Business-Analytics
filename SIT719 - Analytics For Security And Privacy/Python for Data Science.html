<h5><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 8pt;">Image by&nbsp;<a href="https://pixabay.com/users/geralt-9301/?utm_source=link-attribution&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=image&amp;utm_content=3853117" style="color: #000000;">Gerd Altmann</a>&nbsp;from&nbsp;<a href="https://pixabay.com/?utm_source=link-attribution&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=image&amp;utm_content=3853117" style="color: #000000;">Pixabay</a>&nbsp;</span></h5>
<h5><span style="color: #cf2a27;"></span></h5>
<p><span style="color: #cf2a27;"></span>Python is a general-purpose programming language, which means it can utilise at almost everything. The most important thing is that it is an interpreted language, which stands for that the written code has not been translating into a computer readable format at execution time whereas, the major programming languages do this translation before the program runs. This type of language is also known as &ldquo;scripting language&rdquo; because it intends to uses for little projects. The idea of a &ldquo;scripting language&rdquo; has altered significantly since its inception, since Python is now utilising to write large business style applications, rather than just common ones. This dependence on Python has full-grown even more as the Internet gained a reputation. A vast majority of web applications and platforms are dependent on Python, including the Google search engine.</p>

<h2><span style="color: #cf2a27;">Python Key Features</span></h2>
<p>The features of Python are as follow:</p>
<p>1. Accessible to code: Python has a clear syntax that is easy to follow. As compared to many other popular languages such as Java and C++, it is straightforward to code in Python. Anyone can learn the Python syntax in a short time.</p>
<p>2. It is free and open-source: First of all, Python is available freely. Anyone can download it from online. Second, it is an open source, means the source code is accessible to the public. People can download, change, use and distribute it. It refers to FLOSS (free/libre and open source software). As a Python community, they are all moved towards one goal: a Python in constant improvement.</p>
<p>3. Python is a high-level language: Python is a high-level language. It means that programmers do not require remembering the architecture of the system. Neither have they needed to handle the memory. It makes it more user-friendly for the programmer and is one of the critical features of Python.</p>
<p>4. Python is portable: Suppose a programmer has written a Python code for his own Windows machine. Now, if a programmer wants to execute it on a Mac, programmer does not require making changes to it. In other words, the programmer can take a code and run it on any machine. It is not necessary to write separate code for different devices just because of this it makes Python a portable language. However, the programmer should avoid any system- dependent characteristic in this case.</p>
<p>5. The Python language is object-oriented: A programming language that can form the real world is said to be object-oriented. It concentrated on objects, and unites data and functions. On the contrary, a procedure-oriented language rotates around functions, which are codes that can use again and again. Python supports procedural and object-oriented programming, which is the main key feature of Python. It also handles and supports multiple inheritances, unlike Java. A class is a plane for such an object. It is an abstract data type, and it has no values.</p>
<p>6. Python is extensible: If necessary, a programmer can write some of their Python codes in further languages such as C ++. It creates Python an extensible language, which means it can extend to other words. Python is, in fact, a new and powerful language. It has the correct mixture of performance and features that make writing Python programs fun and easy.</p>

<h2><span style="color: #cf2a27;">Why so popular in data science community?</span></h2>
<p>Python&rsquo;s inherent readability and simplicity make it relatively easy to pick up and the number of dedicated analytical libraries available today mean that data scientists in almost every sector will find packages already tailored to their needs freely available for download. Packages such as scikit-learn, SciPy, NumPy, Matplotlib, pandas, and many others represent the backbone of hundreds of production-ready systems and their usage keeps growing. Moreover, complex deep learning applications such as Theano, TensorFlow, and PyTorch allow every Python user to create and train complex models without any speed limits. In fact, it's important to note that Python is not a scripting language anymore. It supports dozens of specific tasks (for example, web frameworks and graphics) and it can be interfaced with native code written in C or C++.</p>
<p>The other great thing about Python&rsquo;s broad and diverse base is that there are millions of users who are happy to offer advice or suggestions when you get stuck on something. Both online and in local meetup groups, many Python experts are happy to help you stumble through the intricacies of learning a new language. And because Python is so prevalent in the data science community, there are plenty of resources that are specific to using Python in the field of data science.</p>
<p>To summarize, following key aspects are the main reason to consider python for data science:</p>
<p>&bull; Python has a strong position in scientific computing: &ndash; Large community of users, easy to find help and documentation.</p>
<p>&bull; Extensive ecosystem of scientific libraries and environments &ndash;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">numpy: <a href="http://numpy.scipy.org">http://numpy.scipy.org</a> - Numerical Python &ndash;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">scipy: <a href="http://www.scipy.org">http://www.scipy.org</a> - Scientific Python &ndash;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">matplotlib: <a href="http://www.matplotlib.org">http://www.matplotlib.org</a> - graphics library</p>
<p>&nbsp;&bull; Great performance due to close integration with time-tested and highly optimized codes written in C, C++ and Fortran.</p>
<p>&bull; Good support for &ndash; Parallel processing with processes and threads &ndash; Interprocess communication (MPI) &ndash; GPU computing (OpenCL and CUDA)</p>
<p>&bull; Readily available and suitable for use on high-performance computing clusters.</p>
<p>&bull; No license costs, no unnecessary use of research budget.</p>
