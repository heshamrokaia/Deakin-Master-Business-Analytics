<h1>Introduction to Week 2</h1>
</div>
<div>
<p>Welcome back! How are you going with these concepts?</p>
<p>Remember you can ask questions on the discussion forum if you get stuck and get support on maths and programming from the IT Help Hub. The Help Hub offers an online seminar room open for questions and support for all students. On campus students are also invited to drop in on campus.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let’s get back to work. Last week we investigated the basics of machine learning. This week we expand these concepts further.</p>
<h3 id="mathematics-and-ml">Mathematics and ML</h3>
<p>ML is based on maths. Maths underlies every decision, iteration and output. To get great results, you need to understand the various mathematical concepts and processes that are the foundation of your results.</p>
<p>An expert Data Engineer will understand and apply these concepts. They will have knowledge and understanding of a range of models, the ability to select models, the parameters (or edges) to apply and understand why some models give better results than others.</p>
<p>Some of the key areas you will explore this weeks are listed below:</p>
<ul>
<li>vectors and basic vector operations</li>
<li>matrices and matrix operations</li>
<li>basic concept of probability</li>
<li>Python programming : using different modules and packages.</li>
</ul>
